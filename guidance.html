<br>
<br>•	If staff members develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., fever or respiratory symptoms), they must:
<br>o	Cease patient care activities.
<br>o	Put on a facemask immediately (if not already wearing).
<br>o	Notify their supervisor or occupational health services prior to leaving work.
<br>
<br>•	If staff have not been tested for COVID-19 and have fever with cough or shortness of breath, they should stay home away from others until 72 hours after fever is gone and symptoms of acute infection resolve.
<br>
<br>•	If staff have been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting results, they should remain under home isolation precautions.
<br>
<br>•	If staff have tested positive for COVID-19, they should remain under home isolation precautions for 7 days from specimen collection OR until 72 hours after fever is gone and symptoms of acute infection resolve, whichever is longer.
<br>
<br>•	If staff have tested negative for COVID-19 and have fever with cough or shortness of breath, they should stay home away from others until 72 hours after fever is gone and symptoms of acute infection resolve.
<br>
<br>If staff members have been exposed to COVID-19 but are asymptomatic:
<br>•	HCW who are exposed to probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should monitor themselves for symptoms.
<br>
<br>•	HCW who are exposed and asymptomatic should wear a facemask (or cloth face covering if PPE is unavailable) while at work for 14 days after the exposure.
<br>
<br>•	HCW should be screened for symptoms prior to working and can continue to work while asymptomatic. 
<br>
<br>•	At this time, a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness should not be required to validate their illness or to return to work, as healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and unable to provide such documentation in a timely way.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">These measures are not commensurate with current U.S. standards of care, however, they may be implemented during PPE shortages:
<br>
<br>•	Reuse refers to the practice of using and removing PPE between multiple patient encounters.
<br>
<br>•	Extended use refers to the practice of wearing the same PPE for repeated close contacts without removal. Extended use is favored over reuse as it is expected to involve less touching and therefore lower contamination risk.
<br>
<br>•	Surgical masks: reuse or extended use of surgical masks may occur when worn in a common area for multiple patient encounters with the same diagnosis or exposure.
<br>o	Some masks received from the Strategic National Stockpile could be expired. These masks may be used, however prioritize for staff who do not provide direct patient care. 
<br>o	For expired masks, please check that the elastic holds mask on securely.
<br>
<br>•	N95 respirators: reuse or extended use has been authorized by the CDC, and a checklist for optimizing the supply of respirators can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/checklist-n95-strategy.html
<br>o	In the event of low supplies, respirators that are not NIOSH-approved, or even not performing adequately for healthcare delivery, can be used.
<br>o	When respirators are exhausted, use the following controls:
<br>	Engineering controls:
<br>•	Use an expedient patient isolation room
<br>•	Use a ventilated headboard to decrease provider risk to aerosol
<br>	Administrative controls:
<br>•	Exclude providers at high risk from contact with COVID-19 patients
<br>•	Designate convalescent providers to care for COVID-19 patients
<br>
<br>•	Gowns: reuse or extended use of cloth isolation gowns, which are usually made of polyester-cotton fabrics, may occur after adequate laundering and sterilization.
<br>o	Extended use of isolation gowns (disposable or cloth) may occur such that the same gown is worn by the same HCW when interacting with more than one patient, if those patients are known to be infected with the same infectious disease, and they are housed in the same location (i.e. COVID-19 patients residing in an isolation cohort).
<br>o	This can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by contact (such as C. difficile) among patients.
<br>o	If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded as per usual practices.
<br>o	https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/isolation-gowns.html
<br>
<br>•	Expired PPE (gowns, respirators, face masks) may be reused beyond the reported shelf-life after passing visible inspection. Materials that are visibly degraded should be discarded.
<br>
<br>High-contact care activities should not involve reuse or extended use of PPE
<br>•	These high-contact resident care activities may increase transfer of pathogens to the hands or clothes of providers:
<br>
<br> 
<br>o	Dressing
<br>o	Bathing/showering
<br>o	Transferring
<br>o	Providing hygiene
<br>
<br>o	Changing linens
<br>o	Changing briefs or assisting with toileting
<br>o	Device care or use
<br>o	Wound care <br></p>

<br>
<br>•	Patients who are COVID-19 negative OR untested should be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days after transfer from a higher acuity facility to a long-term care facility with COVID-19 isolation precautions per the Governor’s Executive Order.
<br>
<br>•	However, if there is active transmission of COVID-19 in the long-term care facility, the discharged patient should be placed and maintained in isolation in accordance with guidelines stating all patients/residents should be in isolation.
<br>
<br>•	Patients who are COVID-19 positive:
<br>
<br>o	Patients should be discharged from higher acuity care based on their clinical needs, NOT based on the isolation period for COVID-19.
<br>
<br>o	Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should remain in isolation for:
<br>	7 days after their COVID-19 test was collected AND
<br>	Until they have been free of fever and symptoms of acute infection* for 72 hours
<br>
<br>•	If a patient is discharged from a higher acuity facility after they have completed their isolation period, the receiving long-term care facility does NOT need to place that patient in isolation.
<br>
<br>•	However, if there is active transmission of COVID-19 in a receiving long-term care (LTC) facility, the discharged patient should be placed in isolation in accordance with the LTC facility guidelines stating all patients/residents should be in isolation.
<br>
<br>•	If a patient is discharged from a higher acuity facility before they have completed their isolation period, the receiving long-term care facility needs to place that patient in isolation until they have completed their isolation period.
<br>
<br>•	If there is no active transmission of COVID-19 in the receiving long-term care facility, only the discharged patient/resident needs to be placed in isolation.
<br>
<br>•	However, if there is active transmission of COVID-19 in the receiving long-term care facility, the discharged patient should be placed and maintained in isolation in accordance with guidelines stating all patients/residents should be in isolation.
<br>
<br>*Symptoms of acute infection is defined as a single temperature of 100.4 0 F (38.0 0 C) and/or cough. This excludes a residual non-productive cough from reactive airways disease or a baseline cough that has not changed.&nbsp;<br></p>
